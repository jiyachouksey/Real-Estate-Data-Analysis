# 🏠 Real Estate Data Analysis (SQL & Python)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes real estate data to understand how **crime rate, pollution, and income levels** affect **median house prices**.  
Using **SQL** for data exploration and **Python (Pandas & Matplotlib)** for visual insights, the project demonstrates how data-driven analysis can reveal real-world housing trends.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **SQL** – Data querying, filtering, and aggregation  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – Data analysis and visualization  
- **Excel** – Preliminary exploration and validation  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project documentation  

## 📊 Visualizations
1. 📉 *Crime Rate vs Median House Price*  
2. 📊 *Average House Price by Pollution Level*  
3. 🥧 *Income Group Distribution*

## 🏁 Key Insights
- Areas with **higher crime rates** tend to have **lower housing prices**.  
- **Air pollution** negatively correlates with **median house prices**.  
- The dataset shows a **dominance of middle-income areas**.

## 🧾 Files Included
- `data.csv` — Source dataset  
- `queries.sql` — SQL scripts used for analysis  
- `visuals.py` — Python visualization code  
- `README.md` — Project documentation
